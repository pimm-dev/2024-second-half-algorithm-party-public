## Polygon Packages
Since we prepared contest using [Polygon](https://polygon.codeforces.com/), the packages also has a Polygon package format.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Because problems are published at Baekjoon Online Judge, we decided to open without some resources to help solve the problems directly.  
> So, the solutions and test cases are not included in this repository.  

To hold a contest in the BOJ, the packages were migrated to the BOJ stack.  
There have been no major changes after migration, but the statements may be some different from the published on BOJ. BOJ revision is the latest.
